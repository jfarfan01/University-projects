### Compile and Run your program
- To compile everything, type `make` in your repository.
- You will find the binaries for your tests in the `/build/` folder, you can start them using `./build/testname`
- You can add and push as many new files in the `/tests/` folder as you like.
- You can modify the `Makefile` and `util.cpp` to your liking, but those files will be disregarded on the testsystem.
