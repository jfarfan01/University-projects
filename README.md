This repository contains varios software projects undertaken during my ongoing Computer Science studies at TU Graz.
Below are descriptions of the work performed by me in each course.


__Algorithms and Games__
Created Python script to play board game Teeko. This program played online against other students'. The general idea behind the program
is to analyze the theoterical value of all possible moves based on both players' positions and choose the best move.

__Computer Graphics__
The first assignment focused on ray tracing. For this purpose, intersection tests of different objects were implemented as well as the actual generation of the rays and the rendering. The bonus task consisted of integrating recursive ray casting for reflective surfaces.
Relevant source code to be found in: Computer Graphics/cgcvmaster-cg-task-1-12130995/source/task1/task1.cpp

The second assignment consists of implementing Volume Raycasting. Here interpolation data is utilized to gather data from an object as
it is being traversed by a ray. This allows us to render the volume of 3d objects.

__Computer Organization and Networks__
Tasks 1a and 1b were performed with hardware descriptor System Verilog. Here machines that perform basic computations were created.
Tasks 3a and 3b served as an introduction to networking with C++.

__Computer Vision__
The first task was an introduction to the OpenCV libray in C++. A series of operations was performed to find the area, perimeter and center
of mass of picture of maps of Austria and Graz.
The second task consisted of implementing the SURF feature detector for impage replacement.

__Introduction to structured programming__
This class introduces the student to procedural in C.
Included in this repository is the final assignment consisting of simpe scrabble game developed almost form scratch with only the help of 
a small framework.

__Machine Learning__
The first task focuses on linear and logistic regression as well as gradient descent. A4 covers K-means and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.

__Object-Oriented Programming 1__
The first assignment consisted of a small messaging service with simple encrypting.
The second assignment was done in a team of 3 and is loosely based on the board game magic maze. I am primarily responsible for the menu and the displaying of the board with all its objects.

__Operating Systems__
In this class groups of 4 work on expanding the features of a basic kernel. The kernel originally only featured single-threaded userspace programs. I worked on implementing multithreading including thread management of user programs through the pthread library as well as the sleep syscall. On the second assignment I worked on implementing swapping for the system including optimization and numerous page replacement algorithms.
The kernel is written in C++ and numerous tests (user programs) were written in C.

__Software Paradigms__
Scala parser and interpreter to expand features of basic programming language. Unit tests were written in order to test newly introduced functinalities. Performed in group of 3. Personally worked on list literals, multiplication, equality operators, anonymou functions, pipes and value forwarding.

__System Level Programming__
This course introduces the student to lower level C concepts like system calls, multi threading and proper thread synchronization, virtual memory and file systems.
A1 focuses on basic syscalls of the pthread library. In A2 the student is given a multi-threaded program without synchronization which is the resposibility of the student. A4 has the student creates and synchronize different processes. A5 is an implementation of the C memory allocator malloc from scratch. It features different tests.
